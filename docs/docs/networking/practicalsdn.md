# Part 1 - SDN and OpenFlow Quick Start

## What is SDN?
- according to Cisco - network programability and network automation
- according to Open Networking Foundation - the physical separation of the network control plane from the forwarding plane, and where a control plane controls several devices
- many definitions

## What is NFV?
Network Functions Virtualization aims to transform the way that network operators architdct networks by evolving standard IT virtualisation technology to consolidate many network equipment types onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage, which could be located in Datacentres, Network Nodes and in the end user premises. It involves the implementation of network functions in software that can run on a range of industry standard server, hardware, and that can be moved to, or instantiated in, various locations in the network as required, without the need for installation of new equipment.

## What is NETCONF?
The NETCONF protocol defines a simple mechanism through which a network device can be managed, configuration data information can be retrieved, and new configuration data can be upoloaded and manipulated. The protocol allows the device to expose a full, formal application programming interface (API). Applications can use this straightforward API to send and receive full and partial configuration data sets.
