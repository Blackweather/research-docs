# OpsCentric DevOps Course: Lesson One
## DevOps as a culture
At its core DevOps is really about breaking down the barriers that traditionally existed between Development and Ops teams.

### Company-specific situations
#### The Traditional Company
- no effort has been made towards implementing DevOps yet or effort has failed
- great opportunity to make an impact
- can be hard
    - culture that resists change

#### The Mid-Transformation Company
- part way through a DevOps transformation

#### DevOps Leadership
- no such thing as a successfully transformed company
- the culture is not a destination, but a journey
    - one of the most important aspects is continuous improvement
- look for the bottlenecks
    - what is slowing down productivity
- does not require a management job title to be impactful
    - often better results by working with the team
