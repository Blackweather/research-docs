# SysOps/DevOps Meetup #12 - 16.01.2020
Next meetup `5.03`

# 1. SRE and hosting - how to give quality and support the client and not marketing cliches

### Principles of SRE
- Keep it simple as Fuck 
    - use ready solutions instead of developing your own
    - choose the easiest way to do things
- do not create other teams for SRE
- Fuckups happen
- automate everything possible
    - measuring the availability of sites
    - automatic banning
    - measure and analyzing something

# 2. Short overview of CI systems
### Cron
- not a CI system
- first kind of automation

### SSH + Bash
- "almost" CD
- not optimal

### Windows scheduler

### Jenkins
- used by a lot people as advanced cron
- offers almost everything, but you need where and what to look for
- is able to establish two-way communication
- no hooks needed
- plugins are developed independently - conflicts between plugins may arise
- consumes a lot of resources
- big maintenance cost
    - problems with updating

### TeamCity
- tool for managers - you can do a chart out of everything
- enterprise product
- code completion
- filtering repositories to check out
- 3rd agent is paid

### Travis
- easy pipeline code format
- great for small projects

### Drone
- great if we have microservices building to docker images and other stuff for CD

### Circle CI
- commands before jobs before workflows
- gated deploy (do you want to continue?)
- everything in yaml

### Tekton
- Google project

### Jenkins-X
- hard to install
- everything in Kubernetes nomenclature
