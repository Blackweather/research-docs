# SysOps/DevOps Meetup #11 - 11.07.2019
Next meetup 9.01

# 1. How we connected our corporate network to AWS
## Public Cloud
Benefits:

- Instant access
- Immediate public IP

<br/>Threats of public cloud:

- Direct access to VM
- Known IP ranges

## Why do we need connectivity?
- Service delivery
- Auditing
- Servers maintenance
- Software deployments
- Logs fetching and analysis

## AWS Security groups
- Briefly: firewall
- Required static public addresses
- Host is still reachable in public network
- Access disabled only for unauthorized addresses

## Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN
- customer gateway + virtual private gateway - define how IPsec tunnel is behaving
- S2S VPN connection
- router - routes packets from EC2 to the Internet through NAT Gateway
- private subnet

### Customer gateway
- endpoint definition
- tunnel initiator
- IP + type

<br/>In definition:

- bgp prefix (can be default)
- IP address of host-gateway
- connection type (i.e. `ipsec.1`)

<br/>Customer gateway must be the initiator of tunnel

### Virtual gateway
- in terraform `aws_vpn_gateway` - confusing
- AWS side endpoint equivalent
- attached to VPC

### Site2Site Tunnel
- customer gateway ID and private gateway ID required
- connection type
- in terraform `aws_vpn_connection`

### Routing
- default routing for VPN connection
- each EC2 get routing automatically after creation
- could be problematic if we were to use shared subnets

# 2. Big eCommerce challenges
LPP uses Magento - meh

## Business indicators
- conversion - ratio of the number of people who did shopping to all people
- site traffic

## Technical indicator
- hits per second - number of responses which are able to be handled by the infrastructure

## Tools
Monitoring - Grafana, Zabbix, Prometheus
BlazeMaster - for Python testing with Locust framework
New Relic - lets you view the stack trace for a specific request

## CPU Affinity
- manages attaching processes to correct threads
